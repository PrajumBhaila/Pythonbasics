# basic data types in python
# string -> '',"""""" collection of characters
# int -> basic number but without decimal point
# float -> decimal number -> 10.5 , 3.14
# complex -> scientific calculations -> 2 + 3j
# array/list -> collection of mutable value
# tuple -> collection of immutable value
# set -> collection of unique mutable value
# dictionary -> key value pair collection

#string
name = " prajum"
# name-> variable -> ram -> binary -> container = name ->
